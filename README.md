# virtual pet 2

Shreya really wants a pet. But nobody else in her family wants to bring a pet in the home. They believe Shreya is not old enough to take care of a pet. Create a virtual pet in such a way that Shreya should be able to take care of it and make sure it does not die.

Add a functionality where Shreya can easily track the food stock she has and the time she feeds the dog. She should also be able to add food in food stock when it is finished.
